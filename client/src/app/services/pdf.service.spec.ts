/**
 * This is the jsPDF type, but with more of its methods exposed.
 *
 * jspdf, the library, clearly distinguishes between its public API and its
 * private, internal API.
 *
 * Now, the @types/jspdf module, which provides type declarations for using
 * jspdf in TypeScript, chooses not to expose methods of the jsPDF class
 * that are part of the public API, but that don't have any documentation.
 *
 * This is the wrong decision; those methods are designated for public use and
 * should not be hidden just because their documentation is incomplete.
 *
 * So, here, we declare a new TypeScript type that includes all of the methods
 * declared in @types/jspdf, plus certain methods that @types/jspdf hides, but
 * that we use here anyway.
